      As part of our <strong>Amal Fellowship</strong>, our team planned an outreach activity in an orphanage house.
      The aim was to spend a day full of learning and fun with the children â€” engaging them in creative games,
      storytelling, and sharing small gifts to spread joy and hope. This initiative is not just an activity,
      but a step towards creating lasting positive memories for the children.
