          <p>
            Our aim is to work with children of various ages to provide them
            educational, character-developing and wellness based facilities. We
            are bringing this to life by prototyping our megaproject by working
            with an orphanage and conducting various wellness based activities
            and sessions for the children, to provide them a fun environment for
            learning.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            The main problem we plan to tackle is the lack of learning
            environments, lack of facilities and opportunities for these young
            children. They have no one to guide them and no one to properly care
            whether they are receiving these opportunities or not. The root
            cause of this is our social issues like lack of awareness, poverty,
            lack of government support and funding.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            People most affected by this are children, especially children in
            institutions like orphanages who have no one to look after them.
            This provides a large gap in the opportunities they have access to,
            eventually leading to lesser skills as they grow up as compared to
            children with greater and better access to resources.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Our demographic for the megaproject is children (ages 5‚Äì17), male or
            female, with markedly low socioeconomic background i.e., they are
            living in orphanages (Private owned or government run).

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Market</h3>
          <p>
            There are various NGO‚Äôs, organizations in Pakistan and
            internationally that are already working to support orphanages and
            provide them with various opportunities. Keeping this in mind, we
            also tried to collaborate with such organizations like Saylani,
            Alkhidmat, Akhuwat Foundation.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">
            While these organizations provide support like clothing or rashan
            drives, our approach is more focused on children ‚Äî interacting with
            them, teaching skills, and building confidence rather than just
            providing material support.
          </p>

            Target Audience / Beneficiary
          </h3>
          <p>
            Our target audience is children with less favorable socio-economic
            backgrounds. Since resources are limited for now, we are working
            with orphaned children. The core issue is how these children are
            behind in academics, social skills and problem solving as compared
            to children with better backgrounds.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">
            These children are often neglected by the state and society. They
            lack guidance, technology access, and wellness opportunities.
            Through our project, we aim to bring hope, confidence and learning
            to them through targeted activities.

          <p>
            My group conducted research thoroughly. First, we looked at
            statistics of orphanages in Pakistan. Although there are
            organizations working to support these institutes, there was no
            approach like ours.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">
            We used observation, interviews and community research to identify
            the gap: lack of proper care, guidance, and wellness for orphaned
            children.

          <p>
            This project is not just an assignment. It‚Äôs a journey of humanity
            and compassion. Working for the well-being of orphaned children has
            taught us the power of teamwork, empathy, and dedication. We have
            learned that even small acts of kindness can create lasting impact.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">
            This project also taught us that change doesn‚Äôt always need huge
            resources ‚Äî sometimes, even a few hours of love and attention can
            make a difference. ‚ÄúWings of Change‚Äù is not just about helping
            others; it‚Äôs about becoming a better, more empathetic version of
            ourselves.
